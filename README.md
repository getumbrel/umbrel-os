# Umbrel Box Base Operating system

![Run Release Script on push to MASTER](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/workflows/Run%20Release%20Script%20on%20push%20to%20MASTER/badge.svg)


Customized Underlying Raspbian Operating System for the Umbrel box (based on https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen)

## Config/Build instructions

1. Run ```sudo ./build.sh```
2. Look in deploy/
3. Use etcher to deploy

Alternatively, you may check the latest release too and you may find the image built automatically by github (upon tagging).

## Default logins

Hostname: umbrel.local
Username: umbrel
Password: umbr3lb0x

You may also find them [here](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/wiki/Box-System-Defaults)

### Config variables

In the config file there are system defaults, which are used when building the image and for automated builds.

* **GITHUB_USERNAME** - Used if you want to automatically log in to the box without typing a password. This is used at build time.

Then theres other raspbian stuff, that you may find in the [Raspbian documentation](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/master/README.md) which will still work.

## Post bootup checks

For building an API (or scripting), look in /home/umbrel/statuses for the following files

* **disk-partitioned** : meaning the disk is partitioned
* **service-configured** : meaning the umbrel system bootup service is configured and running.

(To add more later as needed)
